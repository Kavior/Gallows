Close, but no cigar
Crap or get off the pot
Don't close the barn door after the horse runs away
Don't cry over spilt milk
Don't cry till you are out of the wood
Don't cut off your nose to spite your face
Don't hide your light under a bushel
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't throw out the baby with the bath water
Don't throw out your dirty water until you get in fresh
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater

Feed sparingly and defy the physician
Fish or cut bait

Good fences make good neighbors
In God we trust; all others pay cash
In politics, a man must learn to rise above principle
It takes a thief to catch a thief
It takes nine months to have a baby, no matter how many people you put on the job
It takes one to know one
It takes three generation to make a gentleman
It takes two to make a bargain
Leave well enough alone
Leaves enough, but few grapes
Let the big dog eat
Loose lips sink ships
Love many, trust few and always paddle your own canoe
Make love, not war
Man can't live in this world alone
Man cannot live by bread alone
Of two evils, it is always best to vote for the less hypocritical
Old age is ripeness
Once bitten, twice shy
Opportunities, like eggs, come one at a time
Paddle your own canoe
Pain is forgotten where gain comes
Poets are born, not made
Practice what you preach
Praise makes a bad man worse
Put up or shut up
Take the bitter with the sweet

Variety is the spice of life
We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct
What a story these old walls could tell
When pleasure interferes with business, give up business
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Wishes won't wash dishes
You can't fit a round peg in a square hole
You can't unscramble an egg
You don't put robbers to work in a bank
You made your bed, now lie in it
You make a mountain of a mole-hill
